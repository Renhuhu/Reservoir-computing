These codes are a supplement to the paper entitled "Constructing Polynomial Libraries for Reservoir Computation in Nonlinear Dynamical System Prediction".

It contains versions of reservoir calculations combining polynomial libraries and nonlinear transformation algorithms applied to the lorenz-63 system. The dataset is 15,000 steps long, 10,000 for training and 5,000 for prediction.
The lorenz-96 system as well as the KS equation dataset are too large to upload, you can use the solver to solve any long time step data for testing, if you have any questions you can talk to us at 2661738047@qq.com.

Different computing environment models will have different predictions. The experimental data in the paper was obtained under Windows 2019 operating system, 116 GB RAM and Python 3.7.

Thanks to Ashesh Chattopadhyay and Jaideep Pathak for generously sharing or opening the source code for honest comparison in this paper. See the paper for related details.
